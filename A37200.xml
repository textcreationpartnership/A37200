            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>But they argue; <q>This progreſs of the Covenant eſtabliſheth the Church, <hi>Deut. 29.13. Jer 30.20.</hi> Therefore the contrary doth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſh it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep y.</hi> The Argument is to be denied. For, it will not follow, that, if God did eſtabliſh the Church of the Jews, before the coming of Chriſt, by ſuch a ſucceſſive progreſs of the Covenant in <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.13. therefore he doth ſo now. As for the place <hi>Jer.</hi> 30 20. where it is ſaid, that <hi>the children of the Jews ſhall be as aforetime;</hi> it is meant only of their outward condition, that it ſhall be as good as before the Captivity. See <hi>Engl. Annotat.</hi> This place then is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to Circumciſion or Baptiſm. But there is a manifeſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the conſtitution of theſe Churches. The Church of the Jews before Chriſt, was, for the matter of it, of the Iſraelites deſcended from <hi>Jacob,</hi> by ſucceſſive natural propagation; yet this ſucceſſive progreſs of the Covenant, did not then eſtabliſh the whole Church of Iſrael in the twelve Tribes: for the ten Tribes fell off under <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and never returned again. The Church of the Jews that ſhall be under the <hi>New Jeruſalem,</hi> muſt conſiſt, for the matter of it, of Elect and Sincere Believers onely, both they and their children ſucceſſively to the end of the world, according to the Propheſies in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 50.21. <hi>Ier.</hi> 32.39. Ezek. 37.25-28. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.16, 28. and ſundry other places. But Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Churches among the Gentiles now are conſtituted of viſible Believers, for the matter of them, among whom ſundry cloſe Hypocrites creep in. The progreſs of the Covenant in them, by Chriſts Ordinance, is thus far ſucceſſive, that the children in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority of confederate viſible Believers ſhall be baptized, and thereby bound, when they become adult, to perform the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in their own perſons, and to confederate for themſelves and theirs, as their godly Parents did before them: which if they do not, thoſe Parents by their degeneracy ſtop the ſucceſſive progreſs of the Covenant: In which caſe, Chriſt doth not allow the Churches to provide for a ſucceſſion, by ſetting up a <hi>Meer Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip</hi> of adult perſons, that are viſibly unfit for Church-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56754:29"/> in all Ordinances. Such irregular bringing of men into Memberſhip, will unavoidably bring in the corrupting of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which will end in Apoſtacy. There be better wayes to convey Religion down to after-generations, and to continue a <hi>Nurſery in Chriſts Vineyard,</hi> then this way of ſetting up ſuch a ſucceſſive Memberſhip, which Chriſt hath not ſanctified by his Inſtitution; <hi>viz.</hi> The vigilancy and faithful care and endeavour of Church Elders, and Family-Rulers, to fit them for regular Church-fellowſhip, in the uſing of all ſuitable means, with fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Prayer to God in Jeſus Chriſt for his bleſſing upon the ſame, leaving the iſſue to his All-diſpoſing wiſdome, <hi>who worketh all things according to the counſel of his own will;</hi> according whereunto, he with-holdeth from, and addeth unto the Church whom he will, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2.47. Nor can I but marvel how it comes to paſs, that they who ſeem to approve Mr. <hi>Cottons Treatiſe of the Holineſs of Church-Members,</hi> (which indeed is worthy to be highly approved) do act as they do, in ſetting up ſuch a <hi>Meer Memberſhip</hi> of adult perſons (as hath no agreement with his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription) who are far from perſonal holineſs: The young peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this Countrey, yea, the children of Church-members ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, as well as others, being commonly known to be Profane, Vain, Licentious, Vicious, Diſobedient to Parents, Unfaithful to Maſters, Stubborn, Proud, Self-willed, and yet theſe ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted into immediate perſonal Memberſhip, whereby they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Covenanters for themſelves and theirs; to whom the Lord juſtly ſaith, as in <hi>Pſa.</hi> 50.16, to 23. <hi>What haſt thou to do to take my Covenant into thy mouth?</hi>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Their unfitneſs for ſuch an holy Fellowſhip, as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Churches are, being ſo manifeſt, how can it be rationally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that they who ſubmit not themſelves to the Yoke of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily-Government, will orderly ſubmit themſelves to Chriſts Yoke in Church-cenſure? But, as the admiſſion of ſuch, is without due regard to their Spiritual Fitneſs; ſo the application of Church-cenſures to them, will be diſregarded and ſlighted by them. The Churches will have trouble enough with them, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56754:29"/> diſhonour, and infection, and diſturbance by them, without any acceptance with God, who will ſay, <hi>Who hath required theſe things at your hands?</hi> and without any bleſſed fruit, either to the Church, or to ſuch <hi>Meer Members.</hi> For, God limits his Bleſſing to his own Appointments.

               <hi>Reply.</hi> The Argument hath <hi>Parents</hi> for its Subject, but moſt of the Proofs belong onely to <hi>Infants; viz.</hi> three of them; the other two belong onely to adult perſons, regularly admitted into Church-memberſhip, which therefore doth not concern the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in queſtion.

               <hi>Reply.</hi> By what is anſwered to the former, it appears, that perſonal Memberſhip is of two ſorts; 1. <hi>Purely,</hi> or <hi>meerly Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal;</hi> ſuch is the Memberſhip of adult perſons regularly admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: for their Memberſhip is both <hi>ſubjectively,</hi> and <hi>formally</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal, by their orderly covenanting for themſelves. 2. <hi>Mixtly Perſonal;</hi> ſuch is the Memberſhip of the infants and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in minority of confederate Parents. For their Memberſhip is onely <hi>ſubjectively Perſonal,</hi> but <hi>formally Relative,</hi> by their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents covenanting for them, they being unable to covenant for themſelves. To apply this to childrens Memberſhip, which they unfitly ſtyle <hi>Immediate:</hi> I ſay, <hi>unfitly;</hi> for two things are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the denominating of a <hi>Member,</hi> Mediate or Immediate. 1. <hi>To an Immediate Member,</hi> that his Memberſhip ariſe 1. From his perſonal Faith, made viſible to the Church. 2. From his perſonal Confederating with the Lord and his Church, for himſelf and his ſeed. Such an one is an <hi>Immediate Member,</hi> becauſe his Memberſhip is from himſelf, as well as in himſelf. 2. <hi>To a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Member,</hi> 1. That is Memberſhip ariſeth, not from his perſonal Faith made viſible to the Church, whereof he is not capable, but from his believing confederate Parents. 2. That it is from ſuch Parents covenanting for him. Such an one is a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Member,</hi> becauſe his Memberſhip, though it is <hi>ſubjectively</hi> in himſelf, yet it is <hi>relatively</hi> from his Parents. Whence it will follow, that this kinde of Memberſhip is peculiar to ſuch infants and children in minority, onely during their non-age. This di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of <hi>Mediate</hi> and <hi>Immediate Church-members,</hi> the Writers

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56754:32"/> what is wanting to little children, to inveſt them with an <hi>actual, compleat, proper, abſolute, and immediate memberſhip.</hi> For, though they are in Covenant, which is the <hi>formalis ratio</hi> of their Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip, yet it is mediately, (i. e. <hi>mediance Parentum foedere</hi>) and ſo their Memberſhip is mediate. 2. Divine Inſtitution grants unto the little children of his people ſuch a portion in his Church as they are capable of, during their minority, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points them to be ſuch Members, as ſuch covenanting of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents for them can make them. 3. This Divine Inſtitution makes their Parents Undertakers for ſuch children, and them bound, by their Parents acting, to perform that Covenant, when they ſhall become capable, and when they grow fit, to covenant with the Lord and his people for themſelves and theirs, and ſo to be regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, in their own perſons, by their perſonal act, immediate Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. So that there is wanting unto children in minority, <hi>to make them actual, compleat, proper, abſolute, and immediate Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> A perſonal fitneſs in themſelves, to act in orderly covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for themſelves, which is required in all adult perſons unto immediate Memberſhip. When one comes to be in Covenant in one way, and other in another way; though both are in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, yet theſe different wayes makes their being in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant different, and ſo their Memberſhip. He that comes to be in the Covenant by his own immediate acting, is an immediate Member: He that comes into it by anothers acting for him, is a mediate Member. For, though we are as truly, perſonally, and immediately Members of the Body of faln Mankinde, and by Nature Heirs of Condemnation, as <hi>Adam</hi> was, though he came to it by his own perſonal act, and we by the act of our publick perſon; yet that doth not ſuit the caſe of Infants in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion: for, 1. <hi>Adam</hi> ſtood as a publick perſon, in whoſe loyns all Mankinde were under the firſt Covenant, and to be happy or condemned, by his ſtanding or falling. No Parent is ſuch a publick perſon covenanting for all his Poſterity, but for his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, and children in minority, while they are ſuch, leaving his adult children to Covenant for themſelves, if he hath any ſuch children, when himſelf enters into Covenant. 2. <hi>Adams</hi> Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was onely with the Lord, not with any Church, as the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant

Nor doth the Parents breaking his Covenant, make his children Heirs of Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as <hi>Adams</hi> did all Mankinde. So that this example of <hi>Adam</hi> is impertinently produced in this caſe of infants, and their Parents confederating for them, not as their publick perſon, but as Undertakers for their infant-ſeed by Gods Inſtitution. Nor indeed is any to be accounted a publick perſon, as <hi>Adam</hi> was, but Jeſus Chriſt, for all that are in him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.14, to 20. Nor doth their ſimilitude of <hi>a Prince giving Lands to a man and his heirs ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively, while they continue loyal,</hi> ſuit the caſe in queſtion, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Infants, who cannot be viſibly diſloyal; nor that, concerning adult perſons not regularly joyned to the Church, as immediate Members, whoſe Parents were godly when they covenanted for them in their infancy. For, they have cut off the Entail of the Covenant from themſelves and their Poſterity, by their perſonal diſloyalty: ſo that nothing is given to them and theirs by their Covenant which they preſume to uſurp, without warrant from God. They ſay true, that <q>A member is one, who, according to Rule (or according to divine Inſtitution) is within the viſible Church:</q> But that refutes nothing that I have ſaid, concerning mediate and immediate Members; for both are within the Church according to Rule and Divine Inſtitution, though both have not full commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Church in all Ordinances, which is the priviledge of all adult perſons, who are immediate Members by their own perſonal right, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.12.

            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> The intendment of the Objection (as I apprehend) is to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56754:33"/> ſhew, that compleat and immediate Memberſhip, as ſuch, doth infer compleat and immediate communion in all Church-privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges: But children in minority have not compleat and immediate communion in all Church-priviledges without ſome further act or qualification: Therefore ſuch children are not compleat and immediate Members, as ſuch.

Yet all have that communion that ſuits their Memberſhip: <hi>Infants,</hi> in Baptiſm, the Watch, Prayers, and Bleſſing of the Church, by their Parents covenanting for them: <hi>Adult perſons, orderly and regularly joyned by their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal covenanting for themſelves,</hi> in the Seals, Voting, and Cenſures, which belong to them, as ſuch Members. Nor doth the Scripture any where allow the Church to admit any one by perſonal cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting for themſelves and theirs, into any other Memberſhip then compleat and immediate. But Infants are not capable of ſuch Memberſhip, without ſome further perſonal act and qualification, when they ſhall become adult.

Hence 1. An ordinary Miniſter cannot orderly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form an act proper to his Office, in reference to Church-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, to any that are not regularly and actually Members of the viſible Church, without great uſurpation: as, if a man do a work proper to Magiſtracy, to one that is not under his Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Power, he is an Uſurper.

To adminiſter Baptiſm, is an act of his Office-power: If he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter Baptiſm to children, whoſe Parents are not regularly in Church-order; in ſo doing, why may not the Lord ſay, He is an Uſurper? Suppoſe an unbaptized perſon, profeſſing his Faith, and qualified according to the deſcription in the ſixth Propoſition; yet deferring, for ſome probable cauſes, to adjoyn himſelf to the Church, for the preſent, ſhould deſire Baptiſm of any of theſe Miniſters who framed this Propoſition; Should they adminiſter

If they hear not the Synod, the Synod, having declared them to be Obſtinate, particular Churches, approving and accepting the judgement of the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56754:39"/> Synod, are to declare the ſentence of Non-communion reſpectively concerning them; and thereupon, out of a Religious care to keep their own communion pure, they may juſtly withdraw themſelves from participation with them at the Lords Table, and from ſuch other acts of holy communion, as the Communion of Churches doth otherwiſe allow and require.</q> Thus they ſpeak, in that <hi>Platform.</hi> But, is this, in proportion, according to <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. that <hi>the Neighbour-Churches may firſt withdraw, and then a Synod or Council of Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-Churches muſt be made uſe of for their conviction?</hi> and, <hi>if the Synod declare them to be Obſtinate, particular Churches are to declare the ſentence of Non-communion, and then to withdraw themſelves from all acts of holy communion?</hi> Till they can produce a clear Rule for warrant of ſuch a proceeding, I cannot look at this otherwiſe, then as a meer humane Invention.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Though Churches may <hi>withdraw from a Church that is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate and impenitent</hi> in ſome caſes, (without any ſuch <hi>ſolemn ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Non-communion declared by a Synod</hi>) yet, not for ſuch cauſes as a delinquent Brother may be Excommunicated by a Church, according to <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. For there, though the Offence was in ſome leſſer matter, and private between two at firſt; yet, by obſtinacy againſt convincing light, held forth in thoſe three ſteps of proceeding, it becomes a publick and heinous Scandal, and ſo the Delinquent muſt be at laſt Excommunicated by the command of Chriſt, and the Sentence of the Church, in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Chriſt, who hath for ſuch ends <hi>given the Keyes of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven unto them.</hi> But Neighbour-Churches may not withdraw from a true Church for every <hi>Errour</hi> and <hi>Scandal,</hi> though perſiſted in, and, in their opinion, obſtinately. For 1. It may be the <hi>Errour</hi> of Neighbour-Churches, to think that to be light from Scripture, which they hold forth for their conviction, when it is not from Scripture, rightly underſtood, and rightly applied If the Synod, by whom this Book is publiſhed, ſhould conclude any Church to walk in <hi>Errour,</hi> and <hi>Scandal,</hi> and <hi>Obſtinately,</hi> which ſhall not be convinced from what light they have here held forth, nor practiſe accordingly, till what is Replied <hi>ad oppoſitum,</hi> be ſoundly Refuted, and their Allegations and Applications of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, more convincingly and irrefragably cleared, and <hi>Withdraw</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:56754:39"/> communion from them, after the firſt, ſecond, and third Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and, If any Neighbour-Churches, for this or the like cauſe, ſhould <hi>Withdraw</hi> from communion with them, after the Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one Church, and, after that, of other Neighbour-Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; They ſhould greatly ſin in ſo doing, and act contrary to their own Doctrine in their ſecond Proof of their 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Anſwer to this ſecond Queſtion, <hi>pag.</hi> 28. where they ſay, <hi>To refuſe communion with a true Church, in lawful and pious actions, is unlawful, and juſtly accounted Schiſmatical. For, if the Church be true, Chriſt holdeth ſome communion with it; therefore ſo muſt we.</hi> Now the Churches in <hi>New-England</hi> were approved by their Neighbour-Churches to be true Churches, by their giving unto them the right hand of fellowſhip: and an Errour in leſſer matters, though perſiſted in againſt their Admonitions, (which may be from want of convincing light) doth not make any of them ceaſe to be a true Church. But to <hi>Withdraw</hi> themſelves from all holy communion with ſuch a Church for ſuch a cauſe, is <hi>Total ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from a true Church, which,</hi> themſelves ſay, <hi>is unlawful,</hi> Ibid. 2. The caſes, wherein communion may be regularly <hi>Withdrawn</hi> from a Church or Perſon, are onely ſuch as Subvert the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals of Religion, and are obſtinately perſiſted in, againſt due means regularly uſed with patience for their conviction, being contrary to the <hi>Faith once given to the Saints;</hi> from whence they may be juſtly denominated <hi>Heretical,</hi> Tit. 3.10, 11. 2 Joh. <hi>ver.</hi> 10, 11.

               <hi>Reply.</hi> It doth not neceſſarily follow, till they have proved that Conſociation of Churches by a mutual and ſolemn Covenant is commanded, as Communion of Churches is. Nor do the Texts alledged prove it in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.106. <hi>David</hi> ſwore <hi>to keep Gods righteous judgements,</hi> and would <hi>perform it;</hi> becauſe, though he was not bound to ſwear, yet he had voluntarily ſworn it, and ſo was under a double bond to perform it: for, both his <hi>keeping Gods righteous judgements,</hi> and his <hi>performing that Vow,</hi> were command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.13. with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76.11. 2. And his Vow was private, betwixt God and himſelf. Hence it will not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that Churches are bound to conſociate with a Vow or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, after the manner here deſcribed, which is not proved to be a duty, and may be unſafe for particular Churches. That Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ant, in <hi>Neh.</hi> 10.28, 29. was their Church-covenant renewed and explained, and ſo was a mutual ſolemn Engagement, by <hi>entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Curſe, and into an Oath</hi> (to which form we are not bound) and Church-covenanting is Gods Ordinance, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 19.21. <hi>&amp;</hi> 56.4, to 8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 62.5. all which are Propheſies of the Churches under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. But between the covenanting of a Church within it ſelf, and ſuch a covenanting as this for the conſociating of Churches, there are conſiderable differences. 1. <hi>Becauſe this wants Warrant from the Scripture, which that hath; there being neither any Precept in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56754:41"/> commanding it, nor any Pattern among the Primitive Churches, planted or approved by the Apoſtles, commanding it unto us.</hi> 2. <hi>Nor is there like Reaſon for ſuch Conſociation of Churches by a mutual and ſolemn Agreement or Covenant between Churches in a vicinity, as is for a Church-covenant within it ſelf.</hi> For, the Church-covenant is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, becauſe, without it, the ends of Church-fellowſhip can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be attained. For, 1. Each particular Church is a Spiritual Corporation; which therefore muſt receive its being from a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Combination, or Foederal Engagement. 2. By virtue here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they that had no natural impreſſion to ſubject them to others, or to give them power over them, have mutual power each over o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to command, &amp; conſtrain, as the caſe requires; of which power they could not have been made partakers without mutual Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Engagement. 3. Hereby they come to enjoy ſuch Spiritual and Eccleſiaſtick Priviledges, unto which none can be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted without the approbation and allowance of the whole; which neceſſarily requires this Engagement to the whole, which is by Covenant. Thus Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> argues, to prove <hi>the neceſſity of a Church-covenant,</hi> Survey, <hi>part.</hi> 1. <hi>chap.</hi> 4. <hi>p.</hi> 50, to 55. But the ends of <hi>Church-communion,</hi> (which is mutual helpfulneſs by counſel) may be attained (without ſuch a Conſociation by mutual Engagement) <hi>by the Communion of Churches,</hi> which of it ſelf, without any other Engagement, gives Churches a right and intereſt in another way mutually for their help by counſel, when their needs require it. The Churches in <hi>New-England</hi> have, by the bleſſing of Chriſt, found the benefit of the Communion of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches for ſetling Truth and Peace among them, without ſuch a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation,</hi> and may ſo ſtill. 3. Such an <hi>Agreement between Churches</hi> will become a Snare unto them, by ſtraitning them in the uſe and exerciſe of their Church-power within themſelves, <hi>in re propriâ.</hi> 1. If, by virtue hereof, they may not adminiſter Church-cenſures within themſelves, without concurrence of Neighbour-Churches, or Elders approbation ſought and attained thereunto before: Or, 2. If thereby they ſtand bound under the fore-noted Penalty, to reſt in, and practiſe according to the judgement and advice of ſuch Churches, having ſufficient light and conſent within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves without them. 3. Mr. <hi>Rutherfurd</hi> affirms, <hi>That a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient

He addes: <hi>When God hath made him a combined Member, now, by inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, of one Presbyterian Church, not of another, though by ordinary converſe with other Churches, in caſe of ſcandal, his example may prove prejudicial and infeſtuous to others, yet this Presbytery muſt proceed in Excommunication againſt him, becauſe he is combined with them.</hi> Thus, you ſee, by this voluntary combination of Churches, a Church become a Claſſical or Presbyterian Church, and the Members, by conſenting thereunto, become Members of a Claſſical Church, and under the power of it, ſo as to be Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by it. And is not this Conſociation to be looked at as a Snare to the Churches? which 1. Transforms them from Congregational Churches into a Claſſical Church? And 2. Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects them under the Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction of that Claſſical Church? And 3. Without any warrant of Chriſts Inſtitution?

But that this communion importeth ſuch a Conſociation, as they deſcribe, and obligation to the practice thereof, was not expreſſed, nor underſtood. Worthy Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> (whoſe Name ought to be honourable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Saints, both in <hi>Old England</hi> and <hi>New</hi>) in that Book which he entituled, <hi>The Way of the Churches in New-England,</hi> the ſixth chapter, ſpeaketh of the Communion of Churches, and ſheweth ſeven wayes, whereby it ought to be, and is, in theſe Churches, exerciſed. They do (as I apprehend) reach all the Duties to be performed, by virtue of Church-communion, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, by each other: But of this Conſociation (as it is here
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56754:42"/> deſcribed) he ſpeaketh not a word; nor, I believe, did apprehend any Neceſſity of it, or Rule in Scripture for it. Therefore, when they ſay, <hi>Without this, we ſhall want an expedient and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cure for emergent Church-difficulties and differences;</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant experience of theſe Churches, from their beginning, to this day, evinceth the contrary. And though <hi>our Way is charged with the want hereof;</hi> yet <hi>it is unjuſtly,</hi> and by ſuch as would bring us into their Way of Claſſical Churches, which is not proved to be the Ordinance of Chriſt, as this of the <hi>Communion of Churches</hi> is, and hath been found effectual, by the bleſſing of Chriſt, and ſo will be ſtill. And though <hi>this part of the Doctrine of the Church,</hi> as they call it, concerning ſuch a conſociation, it being not proved to be the Doctrine of Chriſt, was never practiſed in theſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: For without it, the Churches either have been, or might have been, and may be hereafter, kept in purity and peace with Brotherly love among themſelves mutually, by the regular im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the communion of Churches, which is manifeſted to be the Ordinance of Chriſt, who hath given us perfect Rules in the New Teſtament, for the ordering of the communion of Chriſtian Churches, which are ſufficient for attainment of the ends, for which Chriſt hath appointed it, according to the ſecond, third, fourth, eleventh, and twelfth Poſitions premiſed. With which, if this way of Conſociation of Churches ſhall be clearly proved to agree (which I do not finde to be yet done) I ſhall readily and heartily cloſe with it, and ſubmit unto it.

In the fourth Propoſition it is ſaid, <hi>Theſe adult perſons are not therefore to be admitted to full Communion, becauſe they are and continue Members, without ſuch further qualifications as the Word of God requireth thereunto.</hi> But whether the children of ſuch are to be baptized, or not, is not ſaid; and it is neceſſary that it ſhould have been expreſſed, that the ſenſe and meaning of the Synod might be rightly underſtood.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. To the fifth Propoſition many things may be ſaid.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This Propoſition may rationally be looked at, as holding forth the qualifications wanting to full Communion, mentioned in the fourth Propoſition: And if ſo, then it will follow, that ſuch as have theſe qualifications, have right to full Communion: if I miſs it, I would be thankful to him that ſhould ſhew me my miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take; if I am right, and do rightly expreſs the ſenſe of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, it were expedient that the Synod ſhould plainly and fully expreſs their meaning therein, to the underſtanding of all.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The qualifications are, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding the Doctrine of Faith, and profeſſing their Aſſent thereunto; Not ſcandalous in life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. There is more required in a Church-member, even in point of knowledge, then to <hi>underſtand the Doctrine of Faith, and aſſent thereunto.</hi> He ought, in a competent meaſure, to <hi>underſtand Church-Order and Diſcipline appointed by Chriſt,</hi> otherwiſe he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Covenant in judgement, or own the Covenant; neither doth he <hi>know how to behave himſelf in the Houſe of God,</hi> as a Member thereof.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Devil doth <hi>underſtand the Doctrine of Faith,</hi> and doth <hi>aſſent thereunto,</hi> Jam. 2.19.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Not ſcandalous in life,</hi> is wholly Negative, and may be ſaid of irrational Animals. <hi>He</hi> onely <hi>that doth righteouſneſs,</hi> poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, can be denominated <hi>righteous,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.7.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:56754:46"/>4. Beſides all theſe, there muſt be <hi>the work and grace of Faith</hi> held forth, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.37, 38. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16.31-34. before any medling with the Covenant, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 19.21.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is ſaid, <hi>And ſolemnly owning the Covenant,</hi> &amp;c. The Scripture ſpeaketh of <hi>Entring into a Covenant,</hi> 2 Chron. 15.12. of <hi>Making a Covenant with the Lord,</hi> 2 Chron. 29.10. and, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord,</hi> 2 Chron. 34.31. of <hi>Taking hold of the Covenant, Iſa.</hi> 56 4. Now if their <hi>Owning the Covenant</hi> be the ſame; then, not onely their children are to be baptized, but themſelves ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to full Communion; if ſhort, then it is a meer humane invention, not warranted by the Word.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Upon ſuppoſition, that the qualifications expreſſed be found in them, it is ſaid, <hi>Their children are to be baptized.</hi> But</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt and ſecond Propoſitions are againſt it. The firſt Propoſition doth limit Baptiſm to <hi>the Members of the viſible Church:</hi> The ſecond Propoſition doth explain who are meant by <hi>Members of the viſible Church according to Scripture;</hi> 1. <hi>Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate viſible Believers in particular Churches,</hi> (i.) ſuch as have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally and immediately Confederated for themſelves, as the laſt clauſe ſheweth. And 2. <hi>Their Infant-ſeed,</hi> (i.) <hi>children in mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, whoſe next Parents, one or both, are in Covenant.</hi> Now theſe mentioned in the fifth Propoſition, to whom Baptiſm is allowed, are neither the one nor the other. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>grace of Faith is wanting,</hi> if there be no more then the qualifications before mentioned, and that is neceſſary to give their children right to Baptiſm, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38, 39.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The children of ſuch are not to be baptized, who themſelves do live under great offence viſibly, and do not reform,</hi> Exod. 20.5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But ſo do theſe Parents, in not taking hold of the Covenant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally and immediately, for themſelves.</hi> Ergo.</p>
            <p>It may eaſily and abundantly be proved, that ſuch as have been baptized in the Church, and have lived under precious means and great light, untill they are Married, and have children, and all this while have neglected the main thing that doth concern them, which is <hi>to Believe,</hi> and upon their Believing, <hi>perſonally,</hi> and for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to <hi>take hold of the Covenant,</hi> are under very great ſin and offence. But I will onely uſe one Argument, which is this:</p>
            <pb n="69" facs="tcp:56754:46"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Neglect of taking hold of the Covenant, or of entring into Covenant now under Chriſt and the Goſpel, is as groſs a neglect, as great a ſin, as much diſpleaſing to God, as was the neglect of Circumciſion, the ſign of the Covenant before Chriſt.</hi> Grounds of it are:</p>
            <p n="1">1. The thing it ſelf is as weighty, that I ſay not, more.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As fully under command as that, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.23. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.9, 10.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The neglect of it doth as neceſſarily and peremptorily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Gods higheſt diſpleaſure, and everlaſting deſtruction, if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in, as that, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.36. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But that neglect was groſs, the ſin great, and very diſpleaſing to God, Gen.</hi> 17.14. <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.24-26. Ergo.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If the children of ſuch are to be baptized; if their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren again thus baptized, live to have children, themſelves not <hi>perſonally taking hold of the Covenant,</hi> or not <hi>entring into Covenant,</hi> what ſhall become of them? ſhall they be baptized, or not?</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>If not;</hi> it is needful that it ſhould be declared, that all may know where to ſtop, and to underſtand, that this Priviledge is not to exceed the <hi>Third Generation.</hi> Again, <hi>if not,</hi> it is ſtrange that a childe ſhould be begotten or born of a Member, and yet it ſelf be no Member; or, if a Member, have no right to Baptiſm.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>If ſo;</hi> it may be demanded, <hi>By what right?</hi> or, <hi>Where is the ground of their right to Baptiſm? Not in the Grandfather, or Great-Grandfather;</hi> that is generally diſliked: and the ſecond Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth limit it otherwiſe; but in <hi>the immediate Parent,</hi> I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. But, <hi>how is the right of theſe childrens Baptiſm founded upon him?</hi> Not upon <hi>his perſonal Confederating;</hi> for it is ſuppoſed there is none: Nor upon <hi>his owning the Covenant of his father;</hi> for his father made no Covenant: he did onely <hi>own the Covenant of his Parents,</hi> and that gave the right of Baptiſm to his children, as is held forth in the fifth Propoſition, It remaineth therefore, that this Parent of the <hi>third Generation</hi> doth own what his Parent of the <hi>ſecond Generation</hi> (he can go no higher) hath done, and <hi>what is that?</hi> He <hi>entred not into Covenant,</hi> but onely <hi>owned the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant that his father entred into.</hi> And thus theſe laſt children, who are of the <hi>fourth Generation,</hi> do come to have right to Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm, not by <hi>their Parents Confederation,</hi> as the <hi>ſecond ſort</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the ſecond Propoſition; nor by <hi>their Parents owning
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:56754:47"/> their fathers Covenant,</hi> as the <hi>third ſort</hi> ſpoken of in the fifth Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; but <hi>by theſe Parents</hi> (of the <hi>third Generation) owning their Parents</hi> (of the <hi>ſecond Generation) owning the Covenant of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> of the <hi>firſt.</hi> This ſeemeth to be an uncouth way, and very unpleaſant Divinity.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. The ſixth Propoſition I look at as an <hi>Exception</hi> to the fifth; otherwiſe it is croſs unto it, and againſt it. To this I ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. If there be any weight in the Arguments uſed under the <hi>ſixth Conſideration,</hi> againſt the baptizing of children, to whom the fifth Propoſition doth allow Baptiſm; then they are likewiſe of force againſt the baptizing of children mentioned in this ſixth Propoſition.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I cannot but take notice of the ſeveral ſorts of Member<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, all giving right to Baptiſm: <hi>Two</hi> in the ſecond Propoſition, a <hi>Third</hi> in the fifth; a <hi>Fourth</hi> in the ſixth: and if Memberſhip, <hi>without perſonal Confederation by the ſeed of Confederate viſible Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,</hi> doth not end in the <hi>third Generation,</hi> then there is a <hi>Fifth,</hi> and a <hi>Sixth ſort of Memberſhip;</hi> and all theſe are differing one from the other. The two firſt are of God, and according to his Word, the reſt are not.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. The laſt Propoſition ſeemeth to open a very wide gate in the Church, wider then God doth allow, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.2. for though it requireth qualifications in ſuch Members who claim right to Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm for their children in other Churches, by virtue of <hi>Church-communion,</hi> yet it is altogether ſilent of the qualifications of ſuch Churches themſelves, onely they muſt be <hi>Orthodox;</hi> that reſpects the <hi>Doctrine of Faith</hi> alone. There is much more to be attended: A Church may be <hi>Orthodox in matters of Faith,</hi> yet <hi>Scandalous in Practice:</hi> A whole Church may be <hi>under Scandal,</hi> as well as a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſon; and in that caſe another Church may <hi>withdraw from it,</hi> and have no communion either with it, or its Members. And this was, not long ſince, the Judgement and Practice of ſome of the chief Churches and Elders in the <hi>Bay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, a Church may believe the main <hi>Articles of Faith,</hi> yet be ſo <hi>defective in Diſcipline,</hi> yea, ſo <hi>oppoſite to Chriſts Government,</hi> as to lay aſide his <hi>Laws and Inſtitutions,</hi> and ſet up the <hi>Inventions and Traditions of men:</hi> And likewiſe may have ſuch a <hi>corrupt Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,</hi>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:56754:47"/> both in regard of <hi>Matter, Open ſcandalous livers;</hi> and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of <hi>Form, No viſible expreſs Covenant according to the Rules of the Goſpel,</hi> that there can be no ſuch communion held and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with ſuch a Church, or her Members holding communion with it, as is expreſſed in this ſeventh Propoſition, without mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt diſobedience to the Word of God, in theſe, and many other places, <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.4. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.11.</p>
            <p>If the Members of Orthodox Churches may, upon the terms expreſſed in the ſeventh Propoſition, claim Baptiſm for their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in our Churches, by virtue of <hi>Church-communion,</hi> then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have right to communicate with us in the Lords Supper; and then what ſhould hinder but that we may, by virtue of <hi>Church-communion,</hi> occaſionally coming to any of theſe Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Churches, have our children baptized in ſuch a Church, and our ſelves partake in the Supper of the Lord? Or, if we ſhould have occaſion to remove our Habitation to ſuch a place where ſuch an Orthodox Church is, why may we not joyn unto it, and have fellowſhip with it? And if we may ſo do, <hi>New-England</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are of all Chriſtians in the world <hi>moſt miſerable</hi> and fooliſh. We have <hi>ſuffered many things in vain,</hi> in leaving ſuch a Countrey for this; our Eſtates, Friends, Comforts there, to enjoy God, and Chriſt, and our Conſciences in the <hi>Congregational-Way,</hi> in a low afflicted condition in the Wilderneſs, for ſo many years together; and now we muſt loſe thoſe things which we have wrought, and may return to our former ſtate when we pleaſe: which the Lord preſerveus from.</p>
